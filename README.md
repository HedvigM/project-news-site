# News Site
The weeks task was to build a new site that contains: 
1.a picture or video header, 
2.a news section with "big news" a section with "small news cards" using flexbox or grid.
3.and be responsive to differens devices.

I'm happy with my project, and that i managed to finish at all, because this is the week my baby was born and obviously i had other things on my mind. 

## The problem

I approached this project with efficiency in mind. I designed every part of the site before i started to code and i did every thing step by step in a decided order. I used a cat ipsum on every text snippet, if i had more time, maby i would cange so it would look more "real" regarding the text. And i would hade different pictures.
